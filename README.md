# SimpleGradientDescentPOC
## A Simple Gradient Descent Algorithm implemented into C# as a Proof of Concept.

I made this project to test out my C# skills after leaning the basics of C# from a 10 minute video on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFayQioG71A) and a bit of stack overflow, because the next logical step after I learn the basics is to write a fully functional gradient descent algorithm to fit a linear model to a set of points. *Simple and Basic*.

This is just a proof of concept, and to help anyone trying to implement a gradient descent algorithm into their own program. So, I will not commit to this repo a lot.

To fully understand this, I would suggest you learn about derivatives, partial derivatives, and gradients (fancy word for multidimensional derivative).
